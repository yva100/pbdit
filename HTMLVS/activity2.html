            <h3><a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Search the web with Google!</a></h3>

            <p><strong>Google Search</strong> (also known simply as Google or Google.com) is a search engine operated by Google. It allows users to search for information on the Web by entering keywords or phrases. Google Search uses algorithms to analyze and rank websites based on their relevance to the search query. It is the most popular search engine worldwide.</p>

            <p>Google Search is the most-visited website in the world. As of 2020, Google Search has a 92% share of the global search engine market. Approximately 26.75% of Google's monthly global traffic comes from the United States, 4.44% from India, 4.4% from Brazil, 3.92% from the United Kingdom and 3.84% from Japan according to data provided by Similarweb.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://search.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Search the web with Yahoo!</a></h3>

            <p><strong>Yahoo! Search</strong> is a search engine owned and operated by Yahoo!, using Microsoft Bing to power results.</p>

            <p>Originally, "Yahoo! Search" referred to a Yahoo!-provided interface that sent queries to a searchable index of pages supplemented with its directory of websites. The results were presented to the user under the Yahoo! brand. The actual web crawling and data housing was not done by Yahoo! itself â€“ in 2001, the searchable index was powered by Inktomi and later by Google until 2004, when Yahoo! built its own crawler, becoming independent.</p>

            <p>On July 29, 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced a deal in which Bing would henceforth power Yahoo! Search, putting an end to Yahoo!'s in-house crawler. For four years between 2015 until the end of 2018, it was powered by Google, before returning to Microsoft Bing again.</p>

            <p>As of July 2018, Microsoft Sites handled 24.2 percent of all desktop search queries in the United States. During the same period of time, Oath (the then-owner of the Yahoo brand) had a search market share of 11.5 percent. Market leader Google generated 63.2 percent of all core search queries in the United States.</p>
